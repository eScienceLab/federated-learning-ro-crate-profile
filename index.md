# RO-Crate for Federated Learning

**Note:** This is a first draft currently in active development.

## RO-Crate Profile for Federated Learning

A RO-Crate profile for federated learning is being developed as part of the [Fed-A-Crate project](https://elixir-europe.org/how-we-work/scientific-programme/science/hdtr/genomic-data) within the [ELIXIR Human Data and Translational Research programme](https://elixir-europe.org/how-we-work/scientific-programme/science/hdtr).

**Read the profile here: [Federated Learning Profile](federated-learning-profile.md).**

There is an example RO-Crate which follows the profile: [HTML preview](example-fl-crate/ro-crate-preview.html), [JSON-LD](example-fl-crate/ro-crate-metadata.json).

## Example crate details

The example is based on a Flower process.

## Source code

The source code for the profile, example, and helper scripts are publicly available on GitHub: <https://github.com/eScienceLab/federated-learning-ro-crate-profile>.
